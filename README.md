### 游꼴 How to inspect?
1. go to https://infura.io/ and create a new account <br>
2. create a new project for ethereum <br>
3. clone this repository on your desktop <br>
4. open with visual code then go to inspect.js and find "project_id" and "EOA account", then past project_id from infura and your EOA account to them. <br>
5. open cmd <br>
6. write "node inspect.js" <br>
7. this script collect all transaction on ropsten txpool <br>
8. see script below: <br>
```

9.that script was made by console.log(tx) from inspect.js that has a "input" field, "input" means data of transaction, and it has a "to". "to" is refer to smart contract address. <br>
#### tip: if input was "0x0" then "to" is refer to EOA. <br>
10.copy the "to" field then past it in: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/to#code (instead of "to", do not remove "#code" from uri) <br>
11.copy that uri on your chrome <br>
12.copy the contract ABI (application binary interface) <br>
13.goto https://lab.miguelmota.com/ethereum-input-data-decoder/example/ then past ABI and input that available on script. <br>
14.press decode <br>
15.you see this as follow: <br>
```

游꼣 congratulations (you inspect transaction on ropsten with your knowledge, this is usefull when you want to inspect core functionality of protocol!) <br>
